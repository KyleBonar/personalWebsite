In this repository you will find all of the code that makes my website what it is. The website's server is LEMP. I started the webpage with a Genesis CSS framework and have brought over some CSS from Foundation 6 as well. The web page will almost always be in production since I can only commit a limited amount of time to it each week. If there are any questions you have, feel free to contact me at kylewb2011{at}gmail.com .
